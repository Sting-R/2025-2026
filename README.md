**Code**
- If you're adding code, please make it well-documented. We all would like to know what it is doing without digging around
- If you would like to add another WPILib project, make sure to ask beforehand.
- Stick to Java and Python if possible but if you would like to use C++, make it well documented as our team uses Java primarily. (Would need to go in its own WPILib project)
- Add any examples you would like, can be related to the WPILib API or not. Any examples will help further the understanding of others

**General**
- Be civil and kind. Giving constructive criticism is okay, but at least be kind about it
- If you have any questions or have an issue, feel free to start a discussion or open up an issue

Happy Programming!
